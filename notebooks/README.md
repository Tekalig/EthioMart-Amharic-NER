# EthioMart-Amharic-NER Notebooks Folder

This folder contains Jupyter notebooks designed for interactive data analysis, visualization, and documentation of the project's workflows. Each notebook corresponds to a specific task and provides detailed insights into the processes and results.

## Folder Structure

- `data_ingestion_preprocessing.ipynb`: Notebook for Task 1 - data Ingestion and Preprocessing
- `data_labeling.ipynb`: Notebook for Task 2 - Data Labeling
- `ner_training.ipynb`: Notebook for Task 3 - NER Training
- `model_evaluation.ipynb`: Notebook for Task 4 - Model Evaluation

## Key Features

1. **Interactive Analysis**:
   - Notebooks are ideal for step-by-step exploration and visualization of data.

2. **Documentation and Visualization**:
   - Each notebook includes markdown cells for explaining the logic, methods, and results alongside visualizations for clarity.

3. **Integration with `src`**:
   - Core functions and modules from the `src` folder are imported to ensure modular and reusable code.

4. **Parameter Flexibility**:
   - Parameters and configurations are loaded dynamically, often through `.env` or notebook-specific cells.

## Usage

1. Ensure the project dependencies are installed:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
2. Launch Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
3. Open the desired notebook file and run the cells sequentially:

For example, to analyze Task 1, open `data_ingestion_preprocessing.ipynb`
