# EthioMart-Amharic-NER Test Folder

This folder contains test files for the EthioMart-Amharic-NER project. The tests are designed to validate the functionality and correctness of the project's modules and scripts.

## Folder Structure

- `test_data/`: Directory containing test data files used for unit testing.
- `test_src/`: Directory containing test scripts for the project's source code.
- `test_notebooks/`: Directory containing test notebooks for the project's Jupyter notebooks.
- `test_scripts/`: Directory containing test scripts for the project's executable scripts.

## Key Features

1. **Unit Testing**:
   - The test files include unit tests for various functions and modules to ensure they perform as expected.
   - Tests cover edge cases, input validation, and expected outputs to validate the code's correctness.

2. **Integration Testing**:
    - Integration tests validate the interaction between different modules or components of the project.
    - These tests ensure that the project's components work together seamlessly and produce the desired outcomes.
   
3. **End-to-End Testing**:
    - End-to-end tests validate the entire workflow or process, from data ingestion to model evaluation.
    - These tests simulate real-world scenarios to ensure the project functions correctly in a production environment.
   
4. **Coverage Analysis**:
   - The test suite includes coverage analysis to measure the percentage of code covered by tests.
   - Coverage reports help identify untested code paths and improve overall test coverage.

5. **Continuous Integration**:
    - Tests are integrated into the project's CI/CD pipeline to automate testing and ensure code quality.
    - CI/CD processes run tests automatically on code changes to catch issues early and maintain project stability.

## Usage

1. Ensure the project dependencies are installed:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
2. Run the test scripts or notebooks to validate the project's functionality:
3. Check the test results and coverage reports to identify any issues or gaps in the codebase.
4. Modify or extend the tests as needed to cover additional scenarios or functionalities.
5. Integrate tests into the CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and continuous validation.
6. Update the tests as the project evolves to maintain code quality and reliability.
